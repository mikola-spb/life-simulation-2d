# Phase 2 - Core Gameplay

**Status**: In Progress
**Start Date**: 2025-09-30

## Task 1: Character Appearance System with Layered Sprites

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-09-30

### Implementation

Created a comprehensive appearance customization system to replace Phase 1's simple programmatic rectangles with layered character sprites.

### Key Components

1. **Appearance Class** (`src/entities/Appearance.js`)
   - Manages character appearance data (skin tone, hair color, shirt color, pants color)
   - Provides predefined color palettes for each customization option
   - Implements save/load functionality
   - Includes `randomize()` method for generating random appearances
   - Supports cloning for appearance templates

2. **SpriteGenerator Utility** (`src/utils/SpriteGenerator.js`)
   - Creates layered character sprites programmatically
   - Character composed of 6 layers: legs, torso, head, hair, and eyes
   - Supports dynamic appearance updates
   - Generates direction indicators
   - Uses Phaser containers for sprite composition

3. **Player Entity Updates**
   - Modified to use container-based sprites instead of simple rectangles
   - Constructor accepts optional appearance configuration
   - Includes `updateAppearance()` method for runtime customization
   - Save/load now includes appearance data

### Technical Details

- **Sprite Structure**: Phaser Container with layered game objects
  - Layer 1: Legs (rectangle with pants color)
  - Layer 2: Torso (rectangle with shirt color)
  - Layer 3: Head (circle with skin tone)
  - Layer 4: Hair (ellipse with hair color)
  - Layer 5-6: Eyes (small circles for detail)

- **Customization Options**:
  - 5 skin tones (light, medium, tan, brown, dark)
  - 6 hair colors (black, brown, blonde, red, gray, white)
  - 7 shirt colors (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, white, black)
  - 5 pants colors (blue, black, brown, gray, beige)

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: 34 new tests across 3 test files
  - `Appearance.test.js`: 20 tests covering all appearance functionality
  - `SpriteGenerator.test.js`: 7 tests for sprite generation
  - Updated `Player.test.js`: 7 new/updated tests for appearance integration

- **E2E Tests**: 5 new browser tests
  - Appearance object existence
  - Customizable properties validation
  - Container sprite structure verification
  - Save/load persistence
  - Dynamic appearance updates

- **Test Results**:
  - Unit Tests: 95 total tests, 92 passing (3 pre-existing failures from Phase 1)
  - E2E Tests: 5/5 appearance tests passing
  - Build: Successful

### Integration

The appearance system integrates seamlessly with the existing save system. Player appearance is automatically saved to localStorage and restored on game load, preserving character customization across sessions.

### Future Enhancements

This programmatic sprite approach serves as Phase 2 foundation. Future phases can:
- Replace programmatic sprites with actual sprite sheet assets
- Add animation frames for different directions
- Expand customization options (accessories, facial features, etc.)
- Implement character creation UI

### Files Created
- `src/entities/Appearance.js`
- `src/utils/SpriteGenerator.js`
- `src/entities/Appearance.test.js`
- `src/utils/SpriteGenerator.test.js`
- `e2e/appearance-system.spec.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/entities/Player.js`
- `src/entities/Player.test.js`

## Task 3: Basic NPC AI and Dialog System

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-10-01

### Implementation

Created a comprehensive NPC (Non-Player Character) system with AI behaviors and an HTML-based dialog system for player-NPC interactions.

### Key Components

1. **NPC Entity** (`src/entities/NPC.js`)
   - Full character entity using appearance system
   - Multiple AI behaviors: idle, wander
   - Dialog support with interaction detection
   - Physics-enabled with collision
   - Immovable bodies (NPCs don't get pushed by player)

2. **DialogSystem** (`src/systems/DialogSystem.js`)
   - HTML overlay dialog UI (better text rendering than Phaser)
   - Semi-transparent modal background
   - Styled dialog box with NPC name, text, and continue button
   - Keyboard input support (Space, Enter, ESC)
   - Touch-friendly button interface
   - Multi-page dialog support

3. **NPC Data** (`src/data/npcs.js`)
   - Predefined NPCs with unique appearances, behaviors, and dialog
   - NPCs distributed across locations (Shop, Park, Street, etc.)
   - Configured spawn points and wander bounds

4. **Game Integration** (`src/scenes/GameScene.js`)
   - DialogSystem initialization
   - NPC proximity detection (60 units)
   - Interaction prompts when near NPCs
   - "E" key or touch to interact
   - Player movement blocked during dialog
   - NPC updates managed by LocationSystem

### NPC Behaviors

**Idle Behavior**:
- NPC stays in place
- No movement
- Default behavior for stationary NPCs (e.g., shopkeepers)

**Wander Behavior**:
- Random direction changes every 3 seconds
- Configurable speed and wander bounds
- NPCs can walk around designated areas
- Stops when player interacts

### Dialog System Features

- **Visual Design**: Blue gradient background, gold NPC name, white text
- **Interaction Flow**:
  1. Player approaches NPC
  2. Prompt appears: "Talk (E)"
  3. Press E to open dialog
  4. Read dialog pages
  5. Space/Enter to continue, ESC to close
- **Blocking**: Player cannot move or change locations while dialog active
- **Callbacks**: Supports onClose callback for quest/trigger systems

### Technical Details

**NPC Creation**:
```javascript
const npc = new NPC(scene, x, y, {
  id: 'shopkeeper',
  name: 'Shop Keeper',
  appearance: { skin: 'medium', hair: 'brown' },
  dialog: ['Welcome!', 'Come back anytime!'],
  behavior: 'idle'
});
```

**Dialog Usage**:
```javascript
dialogSystem.show({
  npcName: 'Shop Keeper',
  pages: ['Hello!', 'How can I help?'],
  onClose: () => npc.endInteraction()
});
```

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - NPC.test.js: 27 tests (100% passing)
    - Constructor, behaviors (idle/wander), interaction, position methods
  - DialogSystem.test.js: 27 tests (100% passing)
    - UI creation, show/hide, pagination, keyboard input, cleanup
  - Total: 54 new unit tests

- **Build Status**: Successful (9.16s, 334.90 KB gzipped)

### Integration Points

1. **Appearance System**: NPCs use same appearance customization as player
2. **LocationSystem**:
   - Spawns/despawns NPCs per location
   - Manages NPC updates
   - Provides proximity detection
3. **InputController**: Added "E" key for NPC interaction
4. **GameScene**: Orchestrates NPC interactions and dialog flow

### Files Created
- `src/entities/NPC.js` (229 lines)
- `src/systems/DialogSystem.js` (290 lines)
- `src/data/npcs.js` (NPC definitions)
- `src/entities/NPC.test.js` (317 lines, 27 tests)
- `src/systems/DialogSystem.test.js` (27 tests)
- `e2e/npc-interaction.spec.js` (E2E tests for NPCs)

### Files Modified
- `src/scenes/GameScene.js` (NPC interaction logic)
- `src/systems/InputController.js` (Added "E" key)
- `src/systems/LocationSystem.js` (NPC spawning and management)

### Challenges Resolved

1. **Phaser Import in Tests**: Removed unnecessary Phaser import from NPC.js that caused test failures
2. **DialogSystem Cleanup**: Fixed destroy() method to properly handle HTML element removal without null pointer errors
3. **Test Scope Issues**: Fixed NPC test references to use actual sprite instances

### Future Enhancements

- **Advanced AI**: Scheduled behaviors (NPCs move between locations at certain times)
- **Dialog Trees**: Branching conversations with player choices
- **Quest System**: NPCs can give and track quests
- **Relationship System**: NPCs remember interactions with player
- **Speech Bubbles**: Overhead text for ambient NPC chatter

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Terser Minification Error
**Problem**: Build failed with "terser not found" error
**Solution**: Added terser to devDependencies (Vite 3+ requires it as optional peer dependency)

### Challenge 2: Touch Detection
**Problem**: Need to detect touch capability reliably
**Solution**: Check both `'ontouchstart' in window` and `navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0`

### Challenge 3: Diagonal Movement Speed
**Problem**: Diagonal movement was faster than cardinal directions
**Solution**: Normalize direction vector before applying velocity

### Challenge 4: Virtual Joystick Visual Feedback
**Problem**: Joystick thumb could escape the base circle
**Solution**: Clamp thumb position to joystick radius using angle calculation

### Challenge 5: CRITICAL Game Initialization Bug
**Problem**: Game showed only gray canvas, nothing rendered, E2E tests failed
**Root Cause**: GameScene called `createObstacles()` before player creation, causing `this.player.sprite` to be null when adding colliders
**Solution**: Reordered initialization - create player FIRST, then add obstacle colliders
**Impact**: Fixed game-breaking bug, improved E2E tests from 0/5 to 3/5 passing
**Lesson**: Always test in actual browser environment, not just unit tests

---

## Testing Performed

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
- **Framework**: Vitest with happy-dom
- **Coverage**: 79 tests across 4 test files
- **Results**: 74/79 passing (94%)
- **Files Tested**:
  - config.test.js (8 tests, 100%)
  - SaveSystem.test.js (19 tests, 100%)
  - Player.test.js (23 tests, 91%)
  - InputController.test.js (29 tests, 90%)

## Metrics and Results

### Build Output
```
dist/index.html                    2.05 kB │ gzip:   0.79 kB
dist/assets/index-Bh7hTOvC.js  1,491.14 kB │ gzip: 329.25 kB
```

**Analysis**:
- Total size acceptable for Phase 1 (~330KB gzipped)
- Phaser library accounts for most size
- Good compression ratio (4.5x)
- Initial load under 3 seconds on 3G

### Performance
- Development server starts in ~1 second
- Production build completes in ~9 seconds
- Smooth 60 FPS in testing (desktop)
- No performance warnings in browser console

---

## Configuration Management

### Centralized Config (config.js)
```javascript
export const GameConfig = {
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  gravity: 0,
  player: {
    speed: 160,
    sprintMultiplier: 1.5,
    size: 32
  },
  storage: {
    saveKey: 'lifesim_save_v1'
  },
  version: '1.0.0'
};
```

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for game constants
- Easy gameplay tuning
- No magic numbers in code
- Simple version management

---

## Assumptions Made

1. **Target Browsers**: ES6+ support (Chrome 70+, Safari 12+, etc.)
2. **LocalStorage Availability**: Browser has localStorage enabled
3. **Screen Size**: Minimum 320px width for mobile support
4. **Touch Support**: Touch devices have pointer events API
5. **Asset Loading**: Phase 1 uses programmatic graphics (no external assets)
6. **Internet Connection**: Not required for gameplay (only initial load)

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all classes and public methods
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Clear variable and function names
- Explanation of "why" not just "what"

### Organization
- Single responsibility principle for classes
- Separation of concerns (input, rendering, logic)
- No global variables (everything encapsulated)
- Clear import/export structure

### Performance
- Object pooling ready (not yet implemented)
- ScrollFactor(0) for UI elements to avoid recalculation
- Physics bodies only for objects needing collision
- Minimal draw calls (simple shapes)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on Phase 1 completion, ready for Phase 2:

1. **Asset Pipeline**: Replace programmatic graphics with sprite sheets
2. **Animation System**: Add walk/idle animations for player
3. **Character Customization**: UI for appearance selection
4. **World Expansion**: Add more locations and tilemaps
5. **NPC System**: Basic NPCs with pathfinding
6. **Dialog System**: Text boxes for NPC interactions
7. **UI Framework**: Menus, inventory screen, character sheet

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add loading indicators for async operations
2. Implement settings menu (volume, graphics quality)
3. Add debug mode toggle (show collision boundaries)
4. Set up continuous integration for automated builds
5. Test on actual mobile devices (iOS/Android)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Programmatic graphics allowed rapid iteration
2. **Unified Input**: Single input controller prevents bugs and inconsistency
3. **Responsive First**: Designing for mobile constraints first made desktop easy
4. **Save Early**: Auto-save prevents frustration and data loss
5. **Modular Design**: Separating systems makes future expansion easier
6. **Test In Browser**: Unit tests aren't enough - E2E tests caught critical initialization bug
7. **Manual Testing Critical**: Automated tests don't catch everything, always test manually
