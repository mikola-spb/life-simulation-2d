**Status**: Completed

---

## Overview

This worklog documents the implementation of Phase 1 (Foundation) of the life simulation web game. The goal was to establish core infrastructure including responsive canvas, cross-platform controls, basic character movement, and save/load functionality.

---

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Build System: Vite vs Webpack

**Decision**: Use Vite instead of Webpack

**Rationale**:
- Faster development server startup and hot module replacement
- Simpler configuration for modern ES6+ projects
- Better out-of-the-box support for modern browsers
- Native ES modules support
- Smaller bundle sizes with better tree-shaking

**Trade-offs**:
- Vite is newer than Webpack (less mature ecosystem)
- Some legacy plugins may not be available
- Requires modern browser support (acceptable for our target browsers)

### 2. Graphics Approach: Programmatic vs Sprite Assets

**Decision**: Start with programmatic graphics (colored rectangles) for Phase 1

**Rationale**:
- Allows rapid prototyping and testing of core systems
- No dependency on art assets to begin development
- Easy to visualize collision boundaries and physics
- Can be replaced with proper sprites in Phase 2 without code changes

**Implementation**:
- Player: Blue rectangle (0x4a9eff) with white triangle direction indicator
- Obstacles: Brown rectangles (0x8b4513) with physics bodies
- World: Grid lines for visual reference

### 3. Input System Architecture

**Decision**: Unified input controller supporting multiple input methods

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for player input
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Automatic device detection (touch vs keyboard)
- Consistent behavior across platforms

**Implementation Details**:
- `InputController` class handles all input types
- Returns normalized direction vector (-1 to 1)
- Virtual joystick appears only on touch devices
- Joystick positioned in lower-left corner for thumb access
- Both WASD and Arrow keys supported for accessibility

**Touch Controls Design**:
- Joystick activates on touch in left half of screen
- Right half reserved for future action buttons
- Visual feedback with semi-transparent base and colored thumb
- Radius-limited movement for consistent feel
- ScrollFactor(0) to keep UI fixed on screen

### 4. Responsive Canvas Strategy

**Decision**: Use Phaser.Scale.FIT with dynamic dimension calculation

**Rationale**:
- Maintains aspect ratio across all devices
- Prevents distortion of game elements
- Automatically centers game canvas
- Handles window resize events

**Implementation**:
- Base resolution: 800x600 (standard 4:3 aspect)
- Calculate optimal dimensions based on viewport
- Resize handler updates game scale on window resize
- World bounds set independently (1600x1200) for larger play area

### 5. Save System Design

**Decision**: LocalStorage with JSON serialization and auto-save

**Rationale**:
- No server required (aligns with client-side focus)
- Works offline
- Simple and reliable
- Sufficient for Phase 1 scope

**Features Implemented**:
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Save on page close/unload
- Manual save with Ctrl+S
- Version tracking for future migration
- Metadata (timestamp, version)
- Export/import capability for future cloud sync

**Save Data Structure**:
```javascript
{
  version: "1.0.0",
  timestamp: 1727704800000,
  data: {
    player: { x: 400, y: 300 },
    // Future: inventory, stats, world state, etc.
  }
}
```

### 6. Scene Management

**Decision**: Separate BootScene and GameScene

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- BootScene handles asset loading and initialization
- GameScene handles gameplay logic
- Easy to add more scenes (menu, settings, etc.) in future phases

**Current Scenes**:
- `BootScene`: Asset loading with progress bar (currently minimal assets)
- `GameScene`: Main gameplay, player control, world rendering

### 7. Physics Engine

**Decision**: Phaser Arcade Physics (not Matter.js)

**Rationale**:
- Simpler and faster for 2D top-down game
- Sufficient for basic collision detection
- Lower performance overhead
- Easier to understand and debug

**Configuration**:
- No gravity (y: 0) for top-down perspective
- AABB collision detection
- World bounds collision enabled

### 8. Module System

**Decision**: ES6+ modules with explicit .js extensions

**Rationale**:
- Modern JavaScript standard
- Better tree-shaking and code splitting
- Native browser support
- Clear import/export relationships
- Required by Vite for optimal performance

## Implementation Details

### File Structure Decisions

**Organized by Type**:
- `entities/`: Game objects (Player, future NPCs)
- `scenes/`: Phaser scenes
- `systems/`: Cross-cutting concerns (Input, Save)
- `utils/`: Helper functions (future)

**Rationale**: Clear separation makes codebase easier to navigate and maintain as it grows.

### Player Entity Design

**Architecture**: Separate sprite from logic class

```javascript
class Player {
  sprite        // Phaser.GameObjects (visual representation)
  speed         // Movement speed
  direction     // Current direction vector
  // Methods for movement, save/load, etc.
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Player logic separate from rendering
- Easy to swap sprite implementations
- Testable without Phaser scene
- Clean save/load interface

### Configuration Management

**Decision**: Centralized config.js file

**Contents**:
- Game dimensions
- Player settings (speed, size)
- Storage keys
- Physics settings
- Version number

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth
- Easy to tune gameplay
- No magic numbers in code
- Simple to export for mods/balancing

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Terser Minification Error

**Problem**: Build failed with "terser not found" error

**Root Cause**: Vite 3+ made terser an optional peer dependency

**Solution**: Added terser to devDependencies in package.json

**Learning**: Always check peer dependency requirements for build tools

### Challenge 2: Touch Detection

**Problem**: Need to detect touch capability reliably

**Solution**: Check both `ontouchstart` in window and `navigator.maxTouchPoints`

```javascript
this.isTouchDevice = 'ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0;
```

**Rationale**: Some devices (touch laptops) support both, need comprehensive check

### Challenge 3: Diagonal Movement Speed

**Problem**: Diagonal movement was faster than cardinal directions

**Solution**: Normalize direction vector before applying velocity

```javascript
const length = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y);
if (length > 0) {
  direction.x /= length;
  direction.y /= length;
}
```

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent movement speed in all directions

### Challenge 4: Virtual Joystick Visual Feedback

**Problem**: Joystick thumb could escape the base circle

**Solution**: Clamp thumb position to joystick radius

```javascript
if (distance > this.joystickRadius) {
  const angle = Math.atan2(dy, dx);
  thumbX = baseX + Math.cos(angle) * this.joystickRadius;
  thumbY = baseY + Math.sin(angle) * this.joystickRadius;
}
```

---

## Assumptions Made

1. **Target Browsers**: Assumed ES6+ support (Chrome 70+, Safari 12+, etc.)
2. **LocalStorage Availability**: Assumed browser has localStorage enabled
3. **Screen Size**: Minimum 320px width for mobile support
4. **Touch Support**: Assumed touch devices have pointer events API
5. **Asset Loading**: Phase 1 doesn't require external assets (programmatic graphics)
6. **Internet Connection**: Not required for gameplay (only for initial load)

---

## Code Quality Decisions

### Documentation Standards

- JSDoc comments for all classes and public methods
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Clear variable and function names
- Explanation of "why" not just "what"

### Code Organization

- Single responsibility principle for classes
- Separation of concerns (input, rendering, logic)
- No global variables (everything encapsulated)
- Clear import/export structure

### Performance Considerations

- Object pooling ready (not yet implemented)
- ScrollFactor(0) for UI elements to avoid recalculation
- Physics bodies only for objects that need collision
- Minimal draw calls (simple shapes)

---

## Metrics and Results

### Build Output

```
dist/index.html                    2.05 kB │ gzip:   0.79 kB
dist/assets/index-Bh7hTOvC.js  1,491.14 kB │ gzip: 329.25 kB
```

**Analysis**:
- Total size is acceptable for Phase 1
- Phaser library accounts for most of the size
- Gzip ratio is good (4.5x compression)
- Initial load should be under 3 seconds on 3G

### Performance

- Development server starts in ~1 second
- Production build completes in ~9 seconds
- No performance warnings in browser console
- Smooth 60 FPS in testing (desktop)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on Phase 1 completion, the following are ready for Phase 2:

1. **Asset Pipeline**: Replace programmatic graphics with sprite sheets
2. **Animation System**: Add walk/idle animations for player
3. **Character Customization**: UI for appearance selection
4. **World Expansion**: Add more locations and tilemaps
5. **NPC System**: Basic NPCs with pathfinding
6. **Dialog System**: Text boxes for NPC interactions
7. **UI Framework**: Menus, inventory screen, character sheet

### Recommended Improvements

1. Add loading indicators for async operations
2. Implement settings menu (volume, graphics quality)
3. Add debug mode toggle (show collision boundaries)
4. Create automated tests for core systems
5. Set up continuous integration for automated builds
