# Game Development Plan: Life Simulation Web Game

## 1. Game Analysis

### Core Concept
An open-world life simulation game where players have complete freedom to customize their character and make choices about their virtual life, balancing survival needs with economic success through legal and illegal activities.

### Key Requirements Analysis
- **Character Freedom**: Complete customization and role-playing flexibility
- **Survival Mechanics**: Core goal is staying alive with realistic needs
- **Economic System**: Dual-path money earning (legitimate work vs. criminal activities)
- **Realistic World**: Simulation should mirror real-world complexity
- **Complete Agency**: Player should be able to attempt any real-world action

### Game Genre Classification
- **Primary**: Life Simulation / Sandbox
- **Secondary**: Survival, Economic Simulation
- **Reference Games**: The Sims (life sim) + GTA (open world crime) + Don't Starve (survival)

## 2. Technology Stack

### Selected Stack: **Phaser 3 + PWA**

#### Frontend Technology
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3.70+
  - Mature, stable framework with excellent mobile support
  - Built-in physics, asset management, and scene system
  - WebGL and Canvas rendering with automatic fallback
  - Extensive plugin ecosystem

- **Graphics Approach**: 2D Isometric/Top-down
  - More feasible than 3D for cross-platform web deployment
  - Better performance on low-end mobile devices
  - Easier asset creation and management
  - Can achieve "realistic" look through detailed sprite art

- **UI Framework**: Phaser 3 UI + Custom CSS
  - Phaser's built-in UI for in-game elements
  - HTML/CSS overlay for menus and complex interfaces
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes

#### Backend & Data
- **Client-Side Focus**: Minimize server dependency for broader compatibility
- **Local Storage**: HTML5 localStorage for save games
- **Optional Cloud Save**: Future enhancement with simple REST API
- **Asset Delivery**: Static file hosting (CDN capable)

#### Cross-Platform Deployment
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: App-like experience on mobile
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive UI for 320px to 4K displays
- **Touch Controls**: Mobile-optimized input system
- **Offline Capability**: Core game works without internet

### Alternative Stacks Considered
- **Unity WebGL**: Too heavy for mobile browsers, long load times
- **Three.js**: Overkill for 2D game, complexity overhead
- **Native Mobile**: Against requirement for web-only solution
